## 🚀 Quick Start

### The application is ALREADY RUNNING! 🎵

**Access it at:** http://127.0.0.1:5000

### To restart later:
1. **Option 1**: Double-click `start.bat`
2. **Option 2**: Run `python app.py` in terminal

---

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. 🎵 Song-Based Recommendations
- Uses TF-IDF vectorization
- Cosine similarity algorithm
- Analyzes lyrics, genre, mood, artist
- Returns 10 similar songs with match percentages

### 2. 🌤️ Weather-Based Recommendations (STANDOUT FEATURE)
- Auto-detects your location
- Fetches real-time weather data
- Maps weather to music moods
- Suggests 15 weather-appropriate songs

### 3. 🎨 Modern UI/UX
- Glassmorphism design
- Smooth animations
- Responsive layout
- Dark theme

---

## 📝 Optional: Get Weather API Key

For full weather functionality:

1. Go to https://openweathermap.org/api
2. Sign up (free)
3. Get your API key
4. Open `weather_recommendation.py`
5. Replace line 22:
   ```python
   self.api_key = api_key or "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"
   ```
   With your actual key:
   ```python
   self.api_key = api_key or "your_actual_key_here"
   ```

**Note**: The system works in demo mode even without an API key!

---

## 🧪 Test the System

### Test Song Recommendations:
1. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000
2. Search for "Shape of You"
3. Click "Get Recommendations"
4. View 10 similar songs!

### Test Weather Recommendations:
1. Click "Discover Weather Music"
2. Allow location access
3. See weather + music playlist!

## 🎯 How It Works

### Song Recommendations:
1. User searches for a song
2. System finds it in database
3. Creates TF-IDF vector from lyrics, genre, mood
4. Computes cosine similarity with all songs
5. Returns top 10 most similar songs

### Weather Recommendations:
1. Detects user location (GPS)
2. Fetches current weather (API)
3. Maps weather → mood (e.g., Rain → Melancholic)
4. Filters songs by mood and genre
5. Returns curated playlist
